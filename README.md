Odometry Point Selector App for Skystone 2019-2020 FTC season

This app, developed by Mihir Chauhan, is a autonomous path plotting application on Android which enables ease when creating new auto paths on the fly. This app allows you to move many accessories, such as a claw, grabber, etc, as well as base movements such as strafe to position and move to position. When a function is called, it is added to a list which is seen on the right hand side, as well as the many parmaeters for each function being called. If there is any robot movement, a little square robot will move about the field in the real field coordinate plane (144 inch x 144 inch). Coordinates are passed in as inches and start on the bottom right from (0, 0) to the top right, (144, 144). Once created, this app creates a special formated JSON file with all of the movements of accessories and the drivetrain. At the end, you would send it over to the RC (Robot Controller) phone, which has a program to parse the file created by this app, and move the robot to the coordinates you have passed in. You may also load files, edit them, and save them to the original file if any changes are needed to a speific file. This app will simplify the proccess of creating autonomous programs and we can quickly change them before a match in a competition.
